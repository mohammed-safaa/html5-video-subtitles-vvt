Ross Allen, the famous star of countless wildlife
adventure movies, is going to show us on "Guided

00:24.390 --> 00:29.929
Tour" today how he keeps the Ross Allen Reptile
Institute down in Florida's Silver Springs

00:29.929 --> 00:36.640
well-stocked with animals and reptiles. And
a lesson in how he captures dangerous alligators

00:36.640 --> 00:41.979
with his bare hands. They're cruising along
the Silver River keeping a sharp lookout for

00:41.979 --> 00:48.719
the elusive gators. Ross has spotted a big
8 foot alligator in the water and over the side.

00:48.719 --> 00:53.329
One snap of a gator's massive jaws or
even a well-directed flip of its heavy tail

00:53.329 --> 00:58.120
is enough to kill a man. Allen is one of the
few men in the world who dare [lay] right

00:58.120 --> 01:04.000
in their own element. Not many men would come
to grips unarmed and underwater with a 200

01:04.000 --> 01:09.300
pound monster like this one. Ross has had
a lot of experience though. And he's never

01:09.300 --> 01:14.740
yet lost a fight with an alligator. As he
puts it, you only lose a contest with them

01:14.740 --> 01:21.640
once. And he's learned never to underestimate
the strength and speed of the big gators.

01:22.000 --> 01:26.179
Ross is beginning to get this monster under
control. And in just a few seconds he'll have

01:26.179 --> 01:31.670
another fascinating exhibit for the Ross Allen
Reptile Institute. The wildlife expert travels

01:31.670 --> 01:35.590
all over the world to capture the animals
he has on display at Florida's Silver Springs.

01:35.590 --> 01:42.459
But he stalks many of them in the Florida
swamps and jungles too. Thousands of visitors

01:42.459 --> 01:47.459
every day will see the alligator in its new
home in the Ross Allen Reptile Institute at

01:47.459 --> 01:52.860
Florida's Silver Springs along with a [lot]
of other large and small gators on display here.

01:54.060 --> 01:59.590
The Ross Allen Reptile Institute is
a fascinating attraction and the only one

01:59.590 --> 02:05.349
of its kind and size in the world. Let's follow
these visitors on their tour of a real Seminole

02:05.349 --> 02:11.790
Indian village, right on the grounds of the
Institute. These Seminoles, native to Florida,

02:11.790 --> 02:17.420
left the Everglades in 1935 to make their
home at Florida's Silver Springs--living,

02:17.420 --> 02:22.920
working and playing just as their people have
for centuries. Even their colorful costumes,

02:22.920 --> 02:28.579
hand-made by the women of the tribe, remain
unchanged. The Seminole women in the indian

02:28.579 --> 02:33.489
village at Ross Allen's Reptile Institute
are colorfully costumed and they enjoy posing

02:33.489 --> 02:39.249
for visitors' cameras. Many of their intricate
dresses are made up of more than 2000 pieces

02:39.249 --> 02:44.370
of cloth. And the long-skirted garments are
ideally suited to the Florida jungles in which

02:44.370 --> 02:50.299
they live. The women busy themselves with
cooking, weaving, sewing and doll-making in

02:50.299 --> 02:54.299
the typical Seminole huts which are
open for visitors' inspection.

02:57.299 --> 02:59.439
Grinding corn with a mortar and

02:59.439 --> 03:04.180
pestle is hard work but the young girls of
the tribe learn to perform this chore and

03:04.180 --> 03:09.549
many others at an early age. Corn meal is
one of the staples of the Seminole diet. And

03:09.549 --> 03:16.310
the indians have milled their grain in this
primitive fashion for centuries. Francis Osceola

03:16.310 --> 03:20.969
is one of the residents of the indian village
at Ross Allen's Reptile Institute. Here he

03:20.969 --> 03:25.359
demonstrates, as he does for visitors to the
village, how the indians wrestle and subdue

03:25.359 --> 03:31.969
alligators deep in the Everglades. Once the
alligator is wrestled onto its back, it can

03:31.969 --> 03:36.969
actually be lulled to sleep by gentle
strokes on its stomach.

03:38.969 --> 03:40.249
It takes only a few sharp

03:40.249 --> 03:45.010
grunts and a gentle poke to bring the gator
completely back to its senses, full of fight

03:45.010 --> 03:52.010
and ready to go. The littlest Seminole in
the village is a 5-day old infant, posing

03:52.010 --> 03:58.169
here with his mother, Alice Osceola, and Ross
Allen. Ross is more accustomed to handling

03:58.169 --> 04:05.000
wild animals and fighting reptiles than fragile
bundles like this but he's doing his best.

04:07.519 --> 04:11.219
One of the lecturers at Ross Allen's Reptile
Institute seems to be having some trouble

04:11.219 --> 04:17.120
with a heckler in the audience as he attempts
to describe the fine points of a Boa Constrictor.

04:17.120 --> 04:21.549
Well, there's only one way to handle a situation
like this. And that is to make the heckler

04:21.549 --> 04:26.750
a part of the act. Seventeen year old Linda
Kennedy, a University of Georgia student,

04:26.750 --> 04:31.700
goes along with the gag and tries the Boa
Constrictor on for size. That'll teach her

04:31.700 --> 04:38.490
to interfere with a reptile lecture. The Institute,
believe it or not, does a brisk trade in selling

04:38.490 --> 04:44.229
snakes of all kinds and sizes to visitors.
This prospective customer, carefully watched

04:44.229 --> 04:50.619
by his sister, is looking over everything
available before making a decision.

04:50.619 --> 04:55.900
It was a difficult choice for a true reptile fancier
but the youngster finally decided on the Eastern

04:55.900 --> 05:02.250
Hog-Nosed Snake and rejected the Indigo Snake.
It's hard to tell whether his selection meets

05:02.250 --> 05:06.629
with his sister's approval or not but it's
easy to see the Reptile Institute has one

05:06.629 --> 05:09.329
more satisfied customer.

05:13.629 --> 05:18.629
The grounds of Ross Allen's Reptile Institute
are filled with unusual and colorful subjects

05:18.629 --> 05:25.629
for visitors' cameras, like these stately
pink flamingoes in their natural setting.

05:26.420 --> 05:31.810
It's time for another jungle adventure. And
another lesson for young Tom Allen, as Ross

05:31.810 --> 05:36.680
prepares to turn a 20 foot South American
Anaconda loose in the waters of Silver Springs,

05:36.680 --> 05:43.110
just to see how long it takes him to recapture
it. Rita Starling, a member of the Institute

05:43.110 --> 05:48.099
staff, is an interested and somewhat apprehensive
observer. When they let the big snake out

05:48.099 --> 05:54.800
of the burlap sack, she won't have much room
to get out of the way. Helping to untie the

05:54.800 --> 05:59.900
sack, Tom Allen snags his hand on one of the
snake's teeth, right through the burlap. It's

05:59.900 --> 06:05.169
only a scratch, though, as the anaconda isn't
a poisonous snake so Ross allows the youngster

06:05.169 --> 06:08.169
to continue with the demonstration.

06:09.169 --> 06:12.869
Just look at the size of that monster!

06:14.689 --> 06:16.369
Heading away from the boat and

06:16.369 --> 06:20.560
straight for the Guided Tour cameras,
the big Anaconda makes a spectacular

06:20.560 --> 06:26.389
sight swimming through the crystal clear Silver
Springs waters. Ross is right behind the reptile

06:26.389 --> 06:31.310
though. And he begins to work his way up to
the snake's head while Tom stands by.

06:32.310 --> 06:38.309
Now the action really begins as Ross and the enormous
constrictor fight it out on the floor of the

06:38.309 --> 06:43.419
springs. These are some of the most unusual
and exciting films ever made of Ross Allen

06:43.419 --> 06:49.169
in one of the most thrilling episodes of his
adventurous life. While the Anaconda is a

06:49.169 --> 06:54.379
non-poisonous snake, it effectively disposes
of its prey with a constrictive tightening

06:54.379 --> 06:59.389
of its massive coils. In this struggle the
Anaconda frequently succeeds in getting one

06:59.389 --> 07:06.389
or more coils around Ross Allen. The average
15-year old high school student would much

07:06.389 --> 07:13.699
rather tackle his algebra and Latin texts
than a 120 pound Anaconda. But not Tom Allen.

07:13.699 --> 07:19.189
He was raised by his famous father to have
plenty of respect but no fear at all for the

07:19.189 --> 07:24.300
wild animals and reptiles that are the family
business. When it comes time for Tom to take

07:24.300 --> 07:28.369
a hand with the big constrictor, he pitches
in with a will and showed that he's learned

07:28.369 --> 07:29.569
his lessons well.

07:33.569 --> 07:37.740
When it begins to look as though things may
be getting out of hand, with the Anaconda

07:37.740 --> 07:45.750
securing 2 coils around Tom's legs, Ross swims
in to the rescue. A thoroughly subdued Anaconda

07:45.750 --> 07:50.289
is returned to its sack by the father and
son team after a spine-tingling demonstration

07:50.289 --> 07:53.289
here at Florida's Silver Springs.

07:54.589 --> 07:58.520
Completely unharmed by the
underwater exercise, the Anaconda

07:58.520 --> 08:03.199
is returned to the Reptile Institute area
and turned loose so that handlers can replace

08:03.199 --> 08:09.499
the big reptile in its exhibition enclosure.
In the rattlesnake enclosure at the Reptile

08:09.499 --> 08:14.659
Institute, where lecture demonstrations are
given every hour, Ross persuades some Eastern

08:14.659 --> 08:21.110
Diamondbacks to strike at toy balloons, displaying
their lightning like speed. These poisonous

08:21.110 --> 08:25.979
reptiles are every bit as dangerous as they
look. And while Ross may appear to be somewhat

08:25.979 --> 08:30.759
incautiously strolling among them, he's actually
alert for the slightest movement by any of

08:30.759 --> 08:36.030
the snakes around him. This little wriggler
may look harmless enough, he's only several

08:36.030 --> 08:41.320
inches long, but it's a deadly Eastern Coral
Snake, one of the most poisonous found in

08:41.320 --> 08:47.580
this country. The brightly colored Coral Snake,
like most venomous reptiles, will seldom strike

08:47.580 --> 08:54.380
at a human unless provoked. And this one
appears to be provoked enough right now.

08:56.560 --> 09:00.339
Holding one of the Diamondback Rattlesnakes up for
inspection, Ross Allen exhibits the buttons

09:00.339 --> 09:06.210
or rattles on the snake's tail. This end of
the snake makes all the noise and fuss,

09:06.210 --> 09:10.410
Ross says, but it's the other end
you have to watch out for.

09:14.710 --> 09:17.490
The bulky boots worn by Ross Allen and other

09:17.490 --> 09:21.760
lecturers at his Reptile Institute are tough
enough to deflect the fangs of a striking

09:21.760 --> 09:27.209
rattlesnake. And they extend above the usual
height to which a rattler will reach.

09:27.209 --> 09:33.429
Here in slow motion, Ross tempts some of the reptiles
into striking at his boot. Even the slow

09:33.429 --> 09:38.529
motion camera, though, can't take all the
speed out of a fast-moving rattlesnake's action.

09:42.910 --> 09:48.399
Rattlesnake milking, or venom extraction,
is one of the unusual demonstrations given

09:48.399 --> 09:54.260
every hour at the Reptile Institute. The lecturer
secures a firm hold on the snake before placing

09:54.260 --> 09:59.120
its fangs on the receptacle used to catch
the venom. All of the venom collected at Ross

09:59.120 --> 10:04.250
Allen's Reptile Institute is sold to laboratories
where it is used for research and for the

10:04.250 --> 10:09.250
manufacture of antivenins used in
the treatment of snake bite.

10:10.550 --> 10:13.750
A visit to Ross Allen's Reptile
Institute at Florida's

10:13.750 --> 10:17.480
Silver Springs is an exciting
adventure that can be enjoyed from the

10:17.480 --> 10:22.690
safe side of protective enclosures, while
Ross Allen and his staff provide added thrills

10:22.690 --> 10:26.490
as they move expertly about
among the deadly exhibits.

10:28.890 --> 10:29.839
Visitors to Ross Allen's Reptile

10:29.839 --> 10:35.010
Institute at Florida's Silver Springs may
also enjoy several other attractions at this

10:35.010 --> 10:41.790
fabulous central Florida resort on State Highway
40. The exciting Jungle Cruise speedboat ride

10:41.790 --> 10:47.250
is a 5 mile trip along the Silver River through
dense jungle growth and beautifully landscaped

10:47.250 --> 10:52.920
banks. Climaxing the ride is a visit with
a colony of wild monkeys, introduced into

10:52.920 --> 10:56.920
the Florida jungle as an experiment many years ago.

10:56.920 --> 10:59.990
The famous glass-bottomed boats
of Florida's Silver Springs

10:59.990 --> 11:04.839
move up and down the Silver River, circling
the giant springs and giving thousands of

11:04.839 --> 11:08.870
visitors the thrill of a lifetime as they
look into the crystal clear depths beneath

11:08.870 --> 11:14.430
them. Schools of catfish and other varieties
of marine life are seen as well as the remains

11:14.430 --> 11:21.430
of prehistoric mastodons, sunken gardens and
weird underwater phenomena.

11:32.389 --> 11:37.779
Tommy Bartlett's International Deer Ranch
on the spacious grounds of the Springs features

11:37.779 --> 11:44.070
150 tame animals from 18 foreign countries.
Here visitors stroll about among fleet-footed

11:44.070 --> 11:49.329
creatures from all parts of the world, feeding
and petting them freely. The attraction is

11:49.329 --> 11:54.100
unique among animal exhibits and is popular
with children and grown-ups alike.

11:55.100 --> 12:00.990
The world's largest combined collection of horse-drawn
carriages and antique and classic cars turns

12:00.990 --> 12:06.720
back the hands of time for visitors to the
Carriage Cavalcade and Auto Fair at the Springs.

12:06.720 --> 12:11.750
Cars powered by electricity, steam and several
varieties of gasoline engines are on display

12:11.750 --> 12:17.500
in this fascinating exhibit. All of them
restored to perfect running condition.

12:18.880 --> 12:24.310
The Prince of Peace Memorial is one the newest
attractions at the Springs. The series of beautifully

12:24.310 --> 12:29.420
hand-carved scenes, in three dimensions and
natural color, representing the life work

12:29.420 --> 12:34.889
of sculptor-artist Paul Cunningham, depict
the life of Christ. Each of several scenes

12:34.889 --> 12:40.420
from the New Testament on display is housed
in a uniquely attractive chapel, with special

12:40.420 --> 12:43.420
lighting effects and appropriate music.

12:46.420 --> 12:48.209
And when you've seen all these things at Florida's

12:48.209 --> 12:52.740
Silver Springs, there is still the bathing
beach to be visited for a refreshing dip in

12:52.740 --> 12:58.190
the wonderfully clear water. The pure white
sand beach dotted with shady palm trees and

12:58.190 --> 13:03.570
the year-round 72 degree temperature of the
spring-fed water makes it an ideal place for

13:03.570 --> 13:08.170
the whole family to enjoy an outing. And you
never know when you'll find a movie crew at

13:08.170 --> 13:13.110
work here, filming underwater scenes, or a
colorful water ballet troupe rehearsing for

13:13.110 --> 13:15.050
a performance.

13:16.050 --> 13:20.050
Yes, Ross Allen's Reptile Institute
and all the other attractions at Florida's

13:20.050 --> 13:26.029
Silver Springs provide an exciting and unusual
place to spend a holiday. As you have seen

13:26.029 --> 13:27.359
on "Guided Tour".
